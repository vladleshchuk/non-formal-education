üéì Information System for Recording Non-formal Education (ISRNE)üí° About the ProjectThe Information System for Recording Non-formal Education (ISRNE) is a desktop application developed to automate the processes of recording, managing, and systematizing data on non-formal education (certificates, courses, training, etc.) within the university environment (specifically NUVGP).The system provides administrators and responsible personnel with an effective tool to maintain a database of achievements by students and staff in the field of non-formal education and generate necessary reports.‚ú® Key FeaturesUser Authorization: Role-based access control (Administrator, User) to ensure data security.Certificate Management: Functionality for adding, editing, searching, and deleting records of received certificates.Reference Data Management: Creation and management of directories (e.g., course types, disciplines, groups) to standardize data input.Non-formal Education Tracking: Detailed record-keeping of all forms of non-formal education, linked to the individual and date.PDF Integration: Built-in feature (using PdfiumViewer) to display PDF documents (scans of certificates) directly within the application.Query and Reporting: Tools for quick data retrieval and generating customized reports based on various criteria.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackCategoryTechnology / ToolPurposeDevelopmentC# (.NET Framework)Primary programming language.User InterfaceWindows Forms (WinForms)Creating the desktop Graphical User Interface (GUI).DatabaseMicrosoft Access (.accdb)Local storage for all accounting and tracking data.LibrariesPdfiumViewerIntegration for viewing PDF files within the application.üöÄ Installation and LaunchPrerequisitesWindows Operating System.The required .NET Framework version (must be installed on the machine).Deployment StepsClone the Repository or download the project archive:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
